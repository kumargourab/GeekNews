GeekNews, A pure reading App based on Material Design + MVP + RxJava2 + Retrofit + Dagger2 + Realm + Glide

Geek Daily, a pure reading app based on Material Design + MVP + RxJava2 + Retrofit + Dagger2 + Realm + Glide

For the purpose of learning, this material design-style simple reading application basically covers the most popular mainstream framework for Android-side development. The reading content is mainly for programmers/geeks, and currently includes:  

[Knowledge Daily] (http://daily.zhihu.com/)&nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp;Collecting hot topics and new things, there are many
[WeChat Featured] (http://www.tianapi.com/#wxnew)&nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp;Collecting a large selection of news on WeChat, support search
[Dry goods concentration camp] (http://gank.io/)&nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe the largest dry share of domestic third-party clients, including benefits
[Rare Earth Nuggets] (https://gold.xitu.io/)&nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp;The hottest technology distribution platform
[V2EX](https://www.v2ex.com/)&nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp;A place for sharing and exploring, a community of creative workers
<br/>
<b>tips:</b>  

* This project is still in beta, find bugs or have good suggestions. [issue] (https://github.com/codeestX/GeekNews/issues), email (codeest.dev@gmail.com), PR
* IDE prompts that the class that starts with Dagger is directly compiled, and will be automatically generated by Dagger2.
* This project is only used for learning and communication. The ownership of API data is owned by the original company. Please do not use it for other purposes.

## Points

* Use RxJava with Retrofit2 to make network requests
* Encapsulation of thread operations and network request result processing using RxUtil
* Manage the subscription lifecycle with RxPresenter
* Use RxBus to facilitate communication between components
* Use RxJava other operators for delay, polling, conversion, filtering, etc.
* Use okhttp3 to cache the return content of the network, as well as the configuration of logs, timeout reconnection, and header messages.
* Use Material Design controls and animations
* Use MVP architecture for the entire project, corresponding to three packages: model, ui, presenter
* Inject D layer into P layer with Dagger2, inject P layer into V layer, call object directly without new
* Use Realm to add, delete, check, and change reading and collection records.
* Use Glide to do image processing and loading
* Use Fragmentation to simplify Fragment operations and lazy loading
* Use RecyclerView to achieve pull-down refresh, pull-up loading, side-slip delete, long-press drag
* Use x5WebView for viewing pages, better than native WebView experience
* Use SVG and its animation to achieve progressbar effect
* Use RxPermissions for 6.0+ dynamic permission adaptation
* Use Jsoup to parse V2EX site DOM
* Use native night mode, share, feedback
* Includes search, collection, detection and other functions
* All pits stepped on are commented in the project
